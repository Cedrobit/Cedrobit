# Cedrobit
> Teenage "Utility" and "Operating System" Developer

## Greeting
Hey! I'm Daniel Perez, but you can call me Daniel, or even Cedrobit if you'd like. Not much is currently occuring; I'm in the middle of development of an Operating System written within Scratch, as well as a custom shell in Ruby. Nothing else is occuring, really; that makes me glad.
