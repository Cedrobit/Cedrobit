## Cedrobit
> Teenage "Utility" and "Operating System" Developer

### Greeting
Hey! I'm Daniel Perez, but you can call me Daniel, or even Cedrobit if you'd like. Not much is currently occuring; I'm in the middle of development of an Operating System written within Scratch, as well as a custom shell in Ruby. Nothing else is occuring, really; that makes me glad.

### Personality
I'm usually a warm, caring person who is also a leader and likes to lead a group, as well as a person who takes events and plans into action. Recently, I've changed a lot and I'm no longer a lazy and useless person.
